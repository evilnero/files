Simple hotkey script for trade/inventory/stash clicking for Path of Exile. It does not violate POE TOS, because 1 key is bound to 1 action.
Not a bot, but just some mouse movement and clicks.

Designed for 1920-1080 resolution. If you need others, you'll need to adjust coordinates and recomplite/start it with Autohotkey (I can also recommend a script editor there: Scite for AutoHotkey).

Hotkeys (these are on Numpad keys):

CTRL + 0: move a mouse to your inventory's first position.
CTRL + 1-4: click and move mouse 1 position lower
CTRL + 5: Click and move mouse 1 position to the right and on top
CTRL + 6: (deprecated) sends CTRL UP (unpresses CTRL)
CTRL + 7-9: just clicks a mouse 1 time

So, generally, you can move 60 positions faster, because you're pressing not 1 mouse button, but 5 keyboard buttons.
Start with 0 if you need to move to position 1:1, then repeat 1-5 until you're done.
You can start with any other position if you're not pressing 0.
7,8,9 are used to move stuff from your stash fast. Here as well, you're using 3 keys instead of 1.

Maybe it would work better if you'll set high process priority.
