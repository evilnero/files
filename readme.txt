Simple hotkey script for trade/inventory/stash clicking for Path of Exile [clicker]. It does not violate POE TOS, because 1 key is bound to 1 action.
Not a bot, just doing some mouse movement and clicks.

Designed for 1920-1080 resolution. If you need others, you'll need to adjust coordinates and recomplite/start it with AutoHotkey (can recommend a _script editor_ here: Scite for AutoHotkey).

Hotkeys (these are on Numpad):
CTRL + 0: move a mouse to your inventory's first position.
CTRL + 1-4: click and move mouse 1 position lower
CTRL + 5: click and move mouse 1 position to the right and on top
CTRL + 7-9: just clicks a mouse 1 time

Keys _not_ on Numpad:
CTRL + 2 (same as 1-4 on numpad): click and move mouse 1 position lower
CTRL + 3: hold it to click mouse multuple times at minimum delay (similar to scroller button clicker some people use)

So, generally, you can click 60 stacks faster, because you're pressing not 1 mouse button, but 5 keyboard buttons.
Start with CTRL+0 if you need to move to position 1:1, then repeat CTRL+1,2,3,4,5 until you're done.
You can start in any other position if you're not pressing 0.
7,8,9 are used to move stuff stacked in your (premium) stash tabs fast. Here too, you're using 3 keys instead of 1.
